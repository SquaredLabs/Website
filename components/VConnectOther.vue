      If you randomly (or not so randomly) stumbled upon our website and after
      reading it felt a deeper connection to our mission you should seriously
      consider a philanthropic contribution. Most funds will go to feeding
      starving undergraduates on the team.
      <p><strong>Just think:</strong></p>
      <p class="level">At the $1 level:</p>
      <p class="level-reward">
        You can buy a team member half a bottle of iced tea from a UConn cafe.
      </p>
      <p class="level">At the $5 level:</p>
      <p class="level-reward">
        You can buy a team member lunch (if they don‚Äôt mind just having a bowl
        of soup).
      </p>
      <p class="level">At the $10 level:</p>
      <p class="level-reward">
        You can buy a couple of team members half a pizza (footage of them
        fighting over it can be provided).
      </p>
      <p class="level">At the $25 level:</p>
      <p class="level-reward">
        You can sponsor a lunch meeting (we will draw straws for which 2 team
        members will get to eat [appetizers]).
      </p>
      <p class="level">At the $50 level:</p>
      <p class="level-reward">
        You can sponsor a UConn cookie platter for one of our workshops.
      </p>
      <p class="level">At the $100 level:</p>
      <p class="level-reward">
        You can give a 5 team members a 50 cent raise (for one week).
      </p>

        In all seriousness, in addition to food, our lab has a variety of needs
        (from white board markers to computer monitors). Any and all
        contributions are extremely appreciated üòÅ.
