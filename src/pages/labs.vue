              spending a considerable amount of time on design, ensuring that every choice contributes to crafting

              you name it — it’s vetted for consistency with the overall project goals.

              skills that we hope will serve them well beyond UConn.

              built something from nothing — hopefully leaving the internet ever so slightly more useful or
              informative than it was before.

          Students are the lifeblood of any University.
          When they graduate, many will go on to transform the world
          — literally. Yet, academia, with its long-standing obsession
          with status, title, and seniority, too often makes students
          feel unready or incapable of making a difference until they
          have a diploma in their hand
          (maybe it’s their way of justifying their existence in
          the face of people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates,
          Mark Zuckerberg, etc. ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, we believe that’s bogus.
        </p>
        <p>
          At UConn we have some of the brightest,
          most motivated, and hard-working students in the country.
          At squared labs we believe that students need to be
          supported to unleash their creativity
          (and paid well to do it).

          We’re made up mainly of student developers, designers,
          and content specialists. For a complete listing of current
          (and past) squared labs team members see our people page.

        <p>
          The sites we’ve built range from the purely informational
          (e.g., tip.uconn.edu) to the functional (e.g.,
          lincus.uconn.edu) to a hybrid of the two
          (e.g., ip.uconn.edu). They all have a common thread —
          our websites support research and researchers at UConn.

        Organizationally:
        <p>
          We’re a subunit within the Center for Open Research
          Resources &amp; Equipment (also known as COR²E), which is a
          unit within the Office of the Vice President for Research
          (or the OVPR).
        </p>
        Physically:
        <p>
          We’re in room G01 of the Biology/Physics
          building — the mysterious locked room that says
          [squared labs] on the front and looks like some sort of
          company (we’re not).

          We take our work environment seriously, because after all,
          working somewhere that you don’t like is really not all
          that fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The space we’re currently in was formerly an unused
          conference room that was being used as an office for one
          person and storage for furniture and junk.
